  "body": " Numerical Expressions     Write numerical expressions from verbal expressions.    Evaluate numerical expressions using the order of operations.    Apply numerical expressions to solve real-world problems.      This section covers the fundamentals of writing, evaluating, and applying numerical expressions.  Suppose your kitchen sink has sprung a leak. You hire a plumber who charges a flat $50 service fee plus $75 per hour of labor. If the plumber works for 3 hours, how much will you owe?  To calculate the total cost, you could write the following mathematical expression: Evaluating this expression gives the total cost of $275.  The above expression is an example of a numerical expression .    A numerical expression is an expression formed only from numbers and the basic operations of arithmetic. Numerical expressions may also contain grouping symbols like: .     The following are additional examples of numerical expressions:    In this section, we will learn how to write numerical expressions from their verbal descriptions, evaluate them using the order of operations, and apply them to solve real-world problems.     Learn : Writing Numerical Expressions   Translate a Verbal Expression without Grouping Symbols  The verbal expression \"twelve divided by four plus two\" can be translated into the numerical expression:   In general, we can translate such verbal expressions into numerical expressions as follows:    \"five plus three\" (Addition)    \"five minus three\" (Subtraction)    \"five times three\" (Multiplication)    \"five divided by three\" or (Division)      Translate a Verbal Expression   Translate the verbal expression \"eight minus three times two\" into a numerical expression.    The numerical expression is .      Translate a Verbal Expression with Grouping Symbols  When a verbal expression contains grouping symbols like \"the sum of\", \"the difference of\", \"the product of\", or \"the quotient of\", we use parentheses to indicate the grouping in the numerical expression.  For example, the verbal expression \"the sum of five and three times two\" can be translated into the numerical expression:   In general, we can translate such verbal expressions into numerical expressions as follows:   \"the sum of five and three\" (Addition)    \"the difference of five and three\" (Subtraction)    \"the product of five and three\" (Multiplication)    \"the quotient of five and three\" or (Division)      Translate a Verbal Expression with Grouping Symbols   Consider the verbal expression \"two times the difference of six and four\". This can be written as .    Translate a Verbal Expression with Grouping Symbols   Translate the verbal expression \"twelve divided by the sum of four and two\" into a numerical expression.    The numerical expression is .     Write a Numerical Expression   The verbal expression \"the difference of nine and five times the sum of three and two\" can be written as .    Write a Numerical Expression   Write the numerical expression for the verbal phrase \"the sum of eight and seven divided by the difference of four and one\".    The numerical expression is .        Learn : Evaluating Numerical Expressions   In this subsection, we will learn how to evaluate any numerical expressions using the order of operations.  Recall the plumbing problem from above. Suppose you were to hand your friend a slip of paper with just the above expression written on it. Without knowing anything about how you were using this expression, your friend should still be able to correctly interpret and evaluate it to get the same value of 275.  That is the power of mathematical language: it allows us to communicate ideas precisely and unambiguously . Like all mathematical language, numerical expressions are powerful because they communicate a precise meaning independent from any particular problem they model.  To correctly interpret a numerical expression, we must apply the order of operations . These rules specify the proper order for combining the numbers in any expression. In this way, every numerical expression evaluates to a unique value.    The order of operations gives the proper order to evaluate any numerical expression:  First, evaluate inside parentheses (...) and other grouping symbols.  Next, evaluate exponents (powers and roots or radicals).  Then, perform multiplication and division from left to right.  Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right.  Note: Multiplication does not always come before Division, and Addition does not always come before Subtraction. They are performed from left to right as they appear in the expression.  The above order of operations can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS , which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication\/Division, Addition\/Subtraction.     Evaluate numerical expressions using the order of operations   Use the order of operations to evaaluate the numerical expressions from            For example, when evaluating the expression we follow the order of operations as shown below: First, we evaluate inside the parentheses. Next, we compute the exponent. Then, we multiply. Finally, we add and get the expression's value of .   Order of Operations  To evaluate an expression, we must follow the correct order of operations . These rules can be remembered by their acronym PEMDAS:   Parentheses    Exponents    Multiplication and Division (from left to right)    Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)     Note: Multiplication does not always come before Division, and Addition does not always come before Subtraction. They are performed from left to right as they appear in the expression.    Order of Operations Exercise   Evaluate the expression using the order of operations.    The result is .     Evaluate a Numerical Expression   To evaluate the expression , we first calculate the sum inside the parentheses, which gives us , and then multiply by to get .    Write and Evaluate a Numerical Expression   For the verbal expression \"the difference of 10 and 4 multiplied by 2\", we write it as and evaluate it to get .    Evaluate a Numerical Expression with Grouping Symbols   For the expression , we first evaluate the expressions in parentheses to get and , respectively, and then multiply them to get .      Learn : Plan for Problem Solving   Write and Evaluate Expressions   When faced with a problem, first write down the expression that represents the problem, then evaluate it step by step.    Write and Evaluate Expressions Exercise   Write an expression for \"the sum of five and twice a number x\" and evaluate it for .            Exit Ticket        Practice and HW      "
