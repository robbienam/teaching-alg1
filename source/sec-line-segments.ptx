<statement>
    <p>A <term>line segment</term> is a portion of a line consisting of two endpoints and all points on the line which lie between them.
We label the line segment between points A and B as <m>\overline{AB}</m> or equivalently <m>\overline{BA}</m>, where A and B are the endpoints of the segment.
    </p>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
    The <term>measure</term> of a line segment is the distance between its two endpoints. We denote the measure or length of line segment <m>\overline{AB}</m> as <m>AB</m>.
</p>

<p>We now formally define the notion of <term>betweenness of points</term>.

    <title>Betweenness of Points</title>
<definition xml:id="def-betweenness-of-points">
    <statement>
        <p>
            Given three collinear points A, B, and C, we say C is <term>between</term> A and B if AC + CB = AB.         
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>Note, the notion of betweenness is defined only for three points which all lie on the same line. Betweenness is a property of points on a line.
</p>

<p>For such triples of points on a line, the sum of the measure of the partial segments equals the measure of the whole segment.
    Therefore, we can use the concept of betweenness to find the lengths of line segments when given some of the lengths.

    <title>Line Segment Congruence</title>
<definition xml:id="definition-congruence">
    <statement>
        <p>
            Two geometric figures that have the same shape and size are said to be <term>congruent</term>.
        </p>
    </statement> 
</definition>

<p>Two line segments are <term>congruent segments</term> if they have the same measure or length.
</p>

<p>We denote that line segments <m>\overline{AB}</m> and <m>\overline{CD}</m> are congruent by writing <m>\overline{AB} \cong \overline{CD}</m>.
    This implies that the lengths of the segments are equal, i.e., <m>AB = CD</m>.
</p>
<p>Note well the following distinction: Two line segments can be <em>congruent</em>. Two lengths can be <em>equal</em>.
